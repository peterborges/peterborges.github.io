      <h1>Manage My Money</h1>
      <p class="subtitle">Designing clarity into financial wellbeing</p>

      <p><strong>Timeline:</strong> March 2018 â€“ Dec 2019</p>
      <p><strong>Roles:</strong> Strategy, Experience Design, Competitive Research, Member Research, Site Analytics</p>
      <p><strong>Team:</strong> 1 Design Director Â· 1 PM Â· 3 Designers Â· 1 Experience Owner Â· 8 Developers</p>

      <h2>Objective</h2>
      <p>Help members better understand and manage their money through human-centered design and digital tooling, with a focus on increasing financial literacy and engagement.</p>

      <h2>Design Drivers</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Bad UI erodes trust â€” users switch banks when digital tools underdeliver</li>
        <li>Users prefer efficient, focused tools over one-size-fits-all apps</li>
        <li>Feedback loops with real members improved trust and utility</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Success Metrics</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>ðŸ“‰ -13% MSR calls Â· ðŸ“ˆ -28% task time Â· ðŸ’° $7.48M annual savings</li>
        <li>Increased parity between web and native mobile</li>
        <li>Improved personalization and member satisfaction</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Process</h2>
      <h3>Heuristic Evaluation</h3>
      <p>Used internal design guidelines to audit inconsistencies across account summary pages. Uncovered issues around clarity, hierarchy, and unauthenticated access.</p>

      <h3>Research & Competitive Analysis</h3>
      <p>Compared USAA tools to banks and fintechs (Capital One, Simple, etc.) and built an internal research library to close gaps in competitor understanding.</p>

      <h3>Information Architecture</h3>
      <p>Ran IA tests using Treejack to restructure content based on real user behaviors. Simplified and consolidated account hierarchy across savings, checking, and credit products.</p>

      <h3>Prototyping & Testing</h3>
      <p>Developed prototypes in InVision and tested with users via usertesting.com. Iterated based on feedback and performance analytics.</p>

      <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Design system alignment saved dev time and increased modularity</li>
        <li>Data from analytics and user interviews gave credibility to recommendations</li>
        <li>Prototypes helped build trust and secure quick approvals</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Pilot Results</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>-13% drop in support calls</li>
        <li>-28% task time across mobile flows</li>
        <li>$7.48M in projected cost savings</li>
      </ul>

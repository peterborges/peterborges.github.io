      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>Many companies lack real-time visibility into their machines due to fragmented systems, outdated hardware, and inconsistent data standards. These gaps make it difficult to detect issues early, integrate insights, or respond quickly, especially in remote or infrastructure-poor environments.</p>

      <h2>Problem</h2>
      <p>While Viam could collect data from a wide range of input sources and expose it through the UI and exports, the information was fragmented and difficult for users to interpret or act on effectively.</p>

      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <ul class="goals-list">
        <li><i class="fas fa-eye"></i> Enable real-time visibility into robot sensor states</li>
        <li><i class="fas fa-arrows-alt-h"></i> Support bi-directional control for developers and operators</li>
        <li><i class="fas fa-heartbeat"></i> Standardize telemetry UI for machine health</li>
      </ul>         

      <h2>Process</h2>
      <h3>Research & Discovery</h3>
      <p>We conducted interviews with internal stakeholders (product, engineering, support) and shadowed solutions engineers during real machine setup. We also benchmarked tooling from competitors like Arduino and Datadog. These efforts revealed a common theme: while the platform surfaced vast amounts of sensor data, users lacked the context or structure to interpret it confidently. Developers wanted tools that felt native to their workflow — familiar layouts, responsive controls, and streamlined diagnostics.</p>

          <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>

      <h3>Key Insights</h3>
        <ul class="key-insights">
            <li><strong>Sensor data was available, but not actionable</strong> <br>Users were overwhelmed by raw data streams and needed a way to correlate sensor states with system behavior.</br></li>
            <li><strong>Developers wanted control + clarity</strong> <br>Solutions engineers expected joystick-like control with immediate feedback, while devs wanted a way to simulate/test remotely.</br></li>
            <li><strong>Tooling fatigue was real</strong> <br>Many users jumped between multiple dashboards, logs, and command-line tools. They wanted a unified environment.</br></li>
            <li><strong>Familiar patterns helped adoption</strong> <br>Using VS Code-like UI structures (e.g. tabbed panels, left-hand nav) reduced ramp-up time and made TeleOp feel “native” to their workflow.</br></li>
        </ul>


      <h3>Design Approach</h3>
      <p>Sketches, early flows, wireframes, iterations — your thinking and decisions.</p>

      <h3>Key Components</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Live sensor dashboard:</strong> Unified view of camera, LiDAR, GPS, and more</li>
        <li><strong>Custom controls:</strong> Joystick-like interactions for remote navigation</li>
        <li><strong>Diagnostics panel:</strong> Streamlined logs and system health indicators</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Outcomes</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>$2.75M</strong> in signed contracts from early enterprise users</li>
        <li><strong>6+ partnerships</strong> including marine and robotics integrators</li>
        <li>Improved uptime and operational safety for fleet operators</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Reflections</h2>
      <p>What did you learn? What worked well? What might you improve or scale in the future?</p>
      <h4>What went well</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Higher engagement with both business and consumer customers.</li>
        <li>Increased customer conversion</li>
        <li>Reduced effort for our solutions engineering team members.</li>
        <li>Greater developer comfort when using the app.</li>
        <li>Reduced times for task completion.</li>
        <li>Integration of long-standing and blocked backlog items.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Areas for Improvement</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Overall time to develop & launch.</li>
        <li>Phased launched approach would have allowed us to launch faster.</li>
        <li>Simultaneous development of the design language during this effort.</li>
        <li>Balancing other organization demands with a long-term project.</li>
      </ul>
